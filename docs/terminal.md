# Workspace Terminals

The Explorer terminal action opens or focuses a terminal for its selected cwd
in the right panel's existing tab bar. Each terminal tab keeps the cwd it was
created with. Files still mount only their active viewer; terminal panels stay
mounted behind inactive tabs, hidden panels, and session or project switches.

## Lifecycle

- Each new tab generates a random terminal ID before creation. Creation with
  the same ID and cwd is idempotent, including React Strict Mode's repeated
  effects. An existing ID cannot be reused for another cwd.
- `sessionStorage` retains terminal IDs, cwds, and the active terminal layout
  across refresh. Restored tabs first check the existing server instance and
  never silently start replacement processes after expiry or server restart.
- A new PTY gets a 120-second connection lease. Subscribing cancels expiry;
  the last subscriber leaving starts a new 120-second grace period. This also
  collects creations that never establish their initial connection.
- Hiding a panel, switching tabs, and unmounting a component only disconnect
  clients. Explicitly terminating a tab disconnects its event stream immediately
  and prevents pending creation or browser lifecycle callbacks from reconnecting.
  It still waits for creation and in-flight input before deleting the PTY.
  Restart waits for termination before creating a new ID. Failed termination
  leaves the tab available to retry; explicit reconnect checks the same ID and
  never silently creates a replacement shell.
- A shell exit closes the SSE stream and retains its output and exit code in
  the browser. Unobserved server records expire after the same grace period.
- Explicit termination and expiry signal the shell, escalating to SIGKILL after
  two seconds if it ignores SIGHUP. Server shutdown force-kills shells immediately.

## Transport

Output events carry a monotonically increasing UTF-16 offset in SSE `id`.
Reconnections use `Last-Event-ID` (or `after` on an explicit reconnect) and send
only the missing suffix. The server keeps at most 128 KiB of UTF-16 code units;
an older cursor triggers a terminal reset and bounded history replay. This is
bounded output history, not a serialized full-screen terminal snapshot. Slow
SSE consumers are disconnected once their response queue fills.

Input and resizes are serialized. Pending adjacent input is batched so remote
connections do not require one round trip per keystroke; large pastes are split
without splitting Unicode characters. Failed input is not retried because its
delivery may be ambiguous. Reconnect attaches to the same process with a fresh
writer; restart explicitly replaces the process.

`bin/prepare-terminal.js` repairs node-pty 1.1.0's macOS spawn-helper executable
bits during installation, including published/npm-installed Pi Web packages.

Pi Web pins node-pty to `1.2.0-beta.15`, which includes Linux x64 and ARM64
prebuilt binaries. Native module loading is deferred until terminal creation,
so missing or incompatible binaries produce a JSON error with repair instructions.
Empty or non-JSON API errors show the HTTP status and direct users to the server log.

If a native binary cannot load, run
`npm rebuild node-pty --build-from-source --ignore-scripts=false --foreground-scripts` from the
installation directory (for npx, the cache directory containing `node_modules`).
On Debian/Ubuntu, install `python3` and `build-essential` first. This forces a
source build instead of reusing a missing or incompatible prebuilt binary.
Restart Pi Web after repair.

## Verification

The [common baseline](testing.md) covers native PTY, lease, output cursor, input
queue and storage checks, plus controlled whole-component lifecycle callbacks.
`nix run .#test -- core --file components/TerminalPanel.test.mjs` focuses those
callbacks and client contracts. `nix run .#test -- e2e --group terminal` exercises
real PTYs and pinned Chromium against the Nix-built production package through
the genuine Home Manager service in an isolated NixOS guest.
The shared [browser harness](../e2e/README.md#diagnostics-shutdown-and-retention)
isolates HOME/XDG/agent/TMP, traces each context and records owned-service
settlement. Acceptance never uses the installed host service, a development
server or checkout build output. Retained-resource cleanup remains separate.
